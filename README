A vagrant to flash your Gemini PDA
==================================

Gemini PDA flash tools don't work on MacOS and finding the right setup for the VM along with the right Linux setup is tricky. Here is one that just works.
Tested on MacOS.

Instructions:
1- Install VirtualBox and the extensions
2- Install vagrant
3- Install vagrant vbguest plugin
4- Bring up the VM with vagrant

With homebrew:
brew cask install virtualbox virtualbox-extension-pack vagrant
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up

Now you have a VM running which you can use to run Gemini PDA flash tools.
From there on your host OS simply download the flash tools http://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/FlashToolLinux.tgz in the image folder along with the firmware files you want to flash from http://support.planetcom.co.uk/partitionTool.html
Log in the VM using vagrant/vagrant, open a terminal and launch the flash tool with something like: sudo /vagrant/image/FlashToolLinux/flash_tool.sh
Follow the flashing instructions from http://support.planetcom.co.uk/index.php/Linux_Flashing_Guide#Configuring_Flash_Tool

Enjoy!
